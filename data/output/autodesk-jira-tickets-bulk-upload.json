        "description": "Purpose of Use:\nWhile creating a feature pages for our Autodesk products there are situations when Visual Production Artist needs to create a close up still image from the video to show as a feature thumb. We test our designs with customers and have customer feedback that when we fit the entire software screenshot into the page the customer can't read the tiny text and they don't understand the image very well. So we are creating an extremely close-up cropped images and most of the cases the original resolution of the videos we are using from Partners doesn\u2019t allow us to make a sharp and crisp image. I have an idea about upscaling those low resolution images with the use of generative adversarial network (GAN).For my personal use I am using this project: Github.com/waifu2xIt works great from my personal experience, and this would be super helpful when upscaling some pieces of UI for close-up crops for thumbnails as I have mentioned before.This tool is an open source and is not presented in the Pre-approved Use Cases for Generative AI Technology so I wanted to raise a Generative AI request to have permission to work with it.  I have already discussed this idea with my Managers: Borys Schrade, Jonathan Dunn and my colleagues from Visual production team Alex Alcancia-Shaw and Holly Nature. To summarize some legal issues:It will be used on the customer facing web pagesIt will provide better quality of images which will lead in the higher visual quality of some of our pagesThere will be no confidential information uploaded to and GAN since all the assets will be available online for any user worldwide once published anyway\n\nResponse to Request:\nPlease work with your LBP to ensure that the assets you provide to the Generative AI tool for the sole purpose of improving image resolution of such assets are publicly available and do not include Autodesk confidential or proprietary information, or any Partner\u2019s or customer\u2019s confidential or proprietary information\n\nPrompts:\n customer-facing features' thumbnailsexamples: https://damassets.autodesk.net/content/dam/autodesk/www/products/bim-collaborate/fy23/features/images/connected-issues-thumb-370x218.jpghttps://damassets.autodesk.net/content/dam/autodesk/www/products/bim-collaborate/fy23/features/images/collaboration-for-plant-3d-thumb-370x218.jpg\\\\\n\nTicket Number: 87\nJIRA Ticket: https://jira.autodesk.com/browse/GENAIGOV-87",

To achieve this goal, we need to scale our adoption efforts to acquire new users and retain existing ones. We believe that exploring solutions to automate and improve data collection, analysis, and presentation of Voice of Customer data will enhance our team's ability to prioritize efforts effectively.One solution we are exploring is Lovable.dev (https://lovable.dev/). Lovable is a low-code/no-code platform that allows users to build fully functional web applications using natural language. It simplifies the process of creating and customizing apps by integrating with popular tools like Supabase and GitHub. With Lovable, teams can rapidly prototype and deploy applications, making it easy for both technical and non-technical users to collaborate on projects. More information about the product can be found here: https://lovable.dev/gpt-engineer.Our first step will be to run a Proof of Concept (PoC) using dummy data to evaluate the tool. This will include a clear plan on how to conduct and measure the success of the PoC.Our first initiative will be to build a dashboard of Voice of Customer data. By adopting Lovable, we can centralize and streamline the process of collecting, analyzing, and organizing VoC data. Lovable will serve as a dedicated platform to manage all feedback in one place, ensuring that we have a clear, cohesive understanding of customer needs and concerns. This will facilitate more data-driven decision-making for and ensure that user feedback is always accessible and actionable. We do assume that there may be more relevant use cases in longer term, in addition to the Voice of Customer effort. \n\nResponse to Request:\nnan\n\nPrompts:\n We have not fully developed the prompt, but I can provide a early stage draft: Create a Voice of Customer (VoC) dashboard that presents data from various sources, including CSAT (Customer Satisfaction), PSAT (Product Satisfaction), customer feedback, support tickets, feature requests, and forum discussions. The dashboard should help address the current challenge of inconsistencies and misalignment in our feedback data, and contribute to more efficient and data-driven decision-making.\n\nTicket Number: 299\nJIRA Ticket: https://jira.autodesk.com/browse/GENAIGOV-299",

Behind the scenes, Otto AI converts user query in natural language to equivalent GraphQL which is then used to fetch the data from the AEC Data model. For this we are using open-source LLM Zephyr 7b (already approved), which has been fine-tuned on synthetic dataset.RAG Framework Deepseek R1 will be used for RAG framework where it will create vector embeddings from domain documents and answer queries. It can also combine it's results with results from zephyr and show it as combined result. Example -1) Can you tell me what is Fire Rating Compliance from my company's standard documents ? (Here it will only consume results from documents)2) Can you tell me how many doors and windows are there in my design that have Fire Rating assigned ? (Here it will co-work with Zephyr model & together gives the output. The zephyr model will answer how many doors and windows are in design and Claude will get the information on what is Fire Rating. Both results are combined to give an output)It will be used to create synthetic data that improves (fine-tune) existing zephyr model.It could be used to create a synthetic data that could be consumed by itself (like we are doing for zephyr). example  It can be used to create synthetic documents that have domain knowledge.\n\nResponse to Request:\nnan\n\nPrompts:\n1.

        "description": "Purpose of Use:\nThe Unified Design team within the AEC Design organisation has the FY26 target of increasing the adoption of Autodesk Forma from 6000 to 15000 Commercial MAUs. To do this we need to scale our adoption efforts to increase acquisition of new users and retain existing ones. To achieve this we believe exploring solutions that will scale our engagement with customers without the need to increase headcount will be a key driver in our success.One solution we are exploring is Pavlov AI (https://www.trypavlov.com/), a Customer Performance Platform which partly includes \"AI Agents\" to automatically identify and act on signals to increase adoption, retention, and expansion at scale. (here is a more detailed description of the proposal and tool https://hey.trypavlov.com/pavlov-for-autodesk?v=wkq9&amp;tab=28257).We see Pavlov being an additional layer to our techstack which leverages existing customer communication channels e.g emails, in-product messaging (Intercom).Our first steps would be to run a Proof Of Concept to evaluate the tool which will include a clear plan on how to conduct and measure the success of the POC.\n\nResponse to Request:\nnan\n\nPrompts:\nThe platform does not include generative AI functionality for the user e.g prompts etc. The only use of generative AI in the platform is for AI message creation (used by the agents) in which no Pii or customer data is used in this process. Only the name of the attributes are leverages e.g  the AI is informed that the field \"country\" is available but the content of that field is never shared.\n\nTicket Number: 296\nJIRA Ticket: https://jira.autodesk.com/browse/GENAIGOV-296",

        "description": "Purpose of Use:\nSurfer (www.surferseo.com) is an online subscription based tool built for SEO (search engine optimization). SEO is the practice of optimizing our websites for increased web traffic and organic search-driven by SEOis the largest single digital marketing channel in driving both revenue and website traffic. In FY25, organic search drove over $42M in eStore billings, $134M in ACV Pipeline Closed/Won in Period, and over 100 million visits to official Autodesk websites. Due to drastic cuts in our team size and budget, we need to rely on AI SEO and content generation tools to support our work and meet business goals for revenue and traffic growth.There are two use cases we are requesting. Hopeful that both use cases can be approved:1. Generate content outlines to guide the writing for new marketing landing pages or blog articles. (These marketing landing pages and blog articles would be customer facing and published on Dotcom or blogs.autodesk.com.) Content outlines are the structure and bones of a new marketing landing page, giving direction to writers on what needs to be featured in the web copy to meet the objectives of the landing page. They are internal use and are produced in a simple outline form to guide the direction of the writing.The way this tool (Surfer) is different from just using Autodesk GPT for the use case, is it takes into account (a) keyword researchidentifying appropriate keywords to target with optimized landing pages and drive new web traffic-and (b) it also instantaneously reviews the SERPs (search engine results pages) for the keyword and analyzes the top 20-30 search results to understand search intent, competitor share of voice, and how best to create an landing page or blot post to rank highly for the chosen keyword. This is not a feature available through Autodesk GPT today. Using this tool will help us create useful and compelling marketing content that will enable us to be competitive in search and grow new business web traffic.2. Use the AI content generation tools in  Surfer to write the draft copy of the new marketing landing pages. In addition to content outlines, Surfer also has AI writing features available. Once a content outline is generated, the tool can be prompted to then write the actual landing page/article. The goal of using this feature would be to use AI to write the draft of marketing landing page or blog article and then finalize the copy with human writers/editors (either internal Autodesk FTEs, or writing contractors employed by our team). Our intent is not to publish a fully AI written article, but instead would look to differentiate the AI copy writing by updating and changing at least 20%-30% of the draft by a human writer. Ideally we are looking to have both workflows approved, but if the second cannot be approved we would still like to use Surfer for the first use case (generate content outlines for new marketing landing pages or blog articles).\n\nResponse to Request:\nnan\n\nPrompts:\nPrompt 1 Example: Create a content  outline for a marketing landing page focused on [keyword/topic]. This page will target [audience...i.e., cnc programmers, machinists and shop floor managers] and will be informational (top of funnel to middle of funnel) to help the customer better understand the topic. The goal of the page is to introduce the visitor to the topic, answering common and high level questions (such as \"what is topic?\") and then to introduce them to Autodesk software solutions that can help users complete the task associated with this topic. In addition to answering high level questions and featuring Autodesk software, give in the outline the top 3-5 benefits that Autodesk software can help with the task. Find 3-5 relevant articles or resources on www.autodesk.com that can be featured in this content outline to help users learn more about the topic. Also list the top 5-7 frequently asked questions about the topic or how it relates to Autodesk software and solutions. The goal of the page is to educate visitors on the topic, understand how Autodesk software can best meet their needs as it relates to the topic, and get them to sign up for a free product trial.Prompt 2 Example: In editorial style, create a content outline and then write a blog article on [topic...i.e. spice simulation] that is highly informational, helping visitors understand the definition of the topic, the history and trends of the topic, the technology behind it, and current challenges that can be solved by use of Autodesk software (as it relates to the topic). The goal of the page is to educate new blog visitors about the topic and create brand awareness for our [product] and how it can help the user solve challenges with this software.\n\nTicket Number: 314\nJIRA Ticket: https://jira.autodesk.com/browse/GENAIGOV-314",
