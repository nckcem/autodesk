We test our designs with customers and have customer feedback that when we fit the entire software screenshot into the page the customer can't read the tiny text and they don't understand the image very well. So we are creating an extremely close-up cropped images and most of the cases the original resolution of the videos we are using from Partners doesn’t allow us to make a sharp and crisp image. I have an idea about upscaling those low resolution images with the use of generative adversarial network (GAN).For my personal use I am using this project: Github.com/waifu2xIt works great from my personal experience, and this would be super helpful when upscaling some pieces of UI for close-up crops for thumbnails as I have mentioned before.This tool is an open source and is not presented in the Pre-approved Use Cases for Generative AI Technology so I wanted to raise a Generative AI request to have permission to work with it.  I have already discussed this idea with my Managers: Borys Schrade, Jonathan Dunn and my colleagues from Visual production team Alex Alcancia-Shaw and Holly Nature. To summarize some legal issues:It will be used on the customer facing web pagesIt will provide better quality of images which will lead in the higher visual quality of some of our pagesThere will be no confidential information uploaded to and GAN since all the assets will be available online for any user worldwide once published anyway","Please work with your LBP to ensure that the assets you provide to the Generative AI tool for the sole purpose of improving image resolution of such assets are publicly available and do not include Autodesk confidential or proprietary information, or any Partner’s or customer’s confidential or proprietary information"

With Lovable, teams can rapidly prototype and deploy applications, making it easy for both technical and non-technical users to collaborate on projects.

After revising, present the original and revised notes in a two-column table labeled 'Before' and 'After'. Finally, identify any release notes that may be difficult for general users to understand due to technical jargon or acronyms, and list these in a separate bulleted list. Examples of good release notes:* Fixed an issue where Dynamo would crash when copying a file into the OpenFile dialog or the OpenTemplate dialog.* Fixed duplicate package nodes in the library and Add-ons section.* Introduced functionality to unpin and collapse all preview bubbles, including a menu item and a hotkey (CTRL + K) to trigger the command.* Added the ability to hide or show axes in the background 3D preview under View > Background 3D Preview > Show/Hide Helpers.","This is a Teams Copilot agent that cleans up draft release notes.

SEO is the practice of optimizing our websites for increased web traffic and organic search-driven by SEOis the largest single digital marketing channel in driving both revenue and website traffic. In FY25, organic search drove over $42M in eStore billings, $134M in ACV Pipeline Closed/Won in Period, and over 100 million visits to official Autodesk websites. Due to drastic cuts in our team size and budget, we need to rely on AI SEO and content generation tools to support our work and meet business goals for revenue and traffic growth.There are two use cases we are requesting. Hopeful that both use cases can be approved:1. Generate content outlines to guide the writing for new marketing landing pages or blog articles. (These marketing landing pages and blog articles would be customer facing and published on Dotcom or blogs.autodesk.com.) Content outlines are the structure and bones of a new marketing landing page, giving direction to writers on what needs to be featured in the web copy to meet the objectives of the landing page. They are internal use and are produced in a simple outline form to guide the direction of the writing.The way this tool (Surfer) is different from just using Autodesk GPT for the use case, is it takes into account (a) keyword researchidentifying appropriate keywords to target with optimized landing pages and drive new web traffic-and (b) it also instantaneously reviews the SERPs (search engine results pages) for the keyword and analyzes the top 20-30 search results to understand search intent, competitor share of voice, and how best to create an landing page or blot post to rank highly for the chosen keyword. This is not a feature available through Autodesk GPT today. Using this tool will help us create useful and compelling marketing content that will enable us to be competitive in search and grow new business web traffic.2. Use the AI content generation tools in  Surfer to write the draft copy of the new marketing landing pages. In addition to content outlines, Surfer also has AI writing features available. Once a content outline is generated, the tool can be prompted to then write the actual landing page/article. The goal of using this feature would be to use AI to write the draft of marketing landing page or blog article and then finalize the copy with human writers/editors (either internal Autodesk FTEs, or writing contractors employed by our team). Our intent is not to publish a fully AI written article, but instead would look to differentiate the AI copy writing by updating and changing at least 20%-30% of the draft by a human writer. Ideally we are looking to have both workflows approved, but if the second cannot be approved we would still like to use Surfer for the first use case (generate content outlines for new marketing landing pages or blog articles).",
